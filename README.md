# Phase 6 Optimization

Optimization has made us understand that preliminary results cannot be considered as results. There are several meta classifiers which can be added to the primary classifiers where factors such as the confidence coefficient and class variables can be set which gives a better output and better accuracy. Data exploration should be performed on a regular basis to notice the other changes that are taking place in the dataset. Weka and other tools help us in visualizing the data. Better tweaking the set variables can give better accuracy.
